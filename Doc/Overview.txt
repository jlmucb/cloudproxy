Overview for building and using FileProxy
=========================================


FileProxy consists of several programs, utilities, scripts, device drivers, configuration 
files and miscellaneous material.  It is described in the paper "CloudProxy: the Tao of
Trusted Computing" by Manferdelli, Roeder and Schneider in this directory which we
refer to as "the CloudProxy Paper."  It is helpful to read that paper before hacking
on this since it provides a good overview and covers many details we omit here.

The git repository for the latest public release is: xxx at code.google.com.

The git development repository is access controlled and sumbitters must agree
to be bound by the terms of the contributor license, in the Legal Directory
to obtain access to the development version.  Since this is a small project
with tiny staff, there are relatively few contributors at this time.  If you 
are interested in becoming a contributor, please send mail to:

    john.l.manferdelli@intel.com and tmroeder@google.com.

While we welcome contributions, we reserve the right to grant access to the
development repository in our sole good faith discretion and revoke access
to the repository in our sole good faith discretion.

Notes on using the git repository hosted in Berkeley are in gitinstructions.txt.
Public releases are posted to code.google.com.  You can find information on the
public releases are in PublicRelease.txt.

The main programs are:

    1. cryptUtility - an offline crypto utility to sign certificates, generate keys, etc.
    2. KeyNegoServer - a Service accessible via TCP/IP to manage keys in a FileProxy
       activity.
    3. FileServer - a cloud based sevice program accessible via TCP/IP that stores files
        in encrypted format and grants access to FileClient programs under access control.
    4. FileClient - a cloud based service program that performs processing on FileServer
        provided data.

FileProxy requires a DRTM boot of a specially configured Linux OS which you must compile and
link.  We do not distribute Linux binaries of any sort since doing so conflicts with the
license we grant.  However, you may build and use the specially configured Linux.  In
this description, we refer to this specially configured Linux as the "Trusted OS."

The Trusted OS requires hardware that includes a TPM version 1.2, an Intel Processor with
SMX, VT-x, VT-d and TXT.  Most i7 processors and many i5 processors meet this criteria.
Some AMD processors provide equivalent functionality and may well run FilePorxy without
modification.

We also include material required to build the Trusted OS and make changes to our system.
This includes:
    1. A custom device driver called tcioDD.
    2. Shell scripts to incorporate and configure dmcrypt which we use to protect swap.
    3. TBOOT, an open source program from Intel that we use to perform the DRTM of the
        Trusted OS.
    4. Instructions and shell scripts to initialize the TPM.
    5. Instructions and shell scripts to build a custom initramfs used by computers
        running FileClient and FileServer.
    6. The source code and make file for tcioDD.
    7.  Instructions on building, configuring and operating a complete FileProxy activity.

As described in the CloudProxy paper, FileProxy runs on three computers:
    1. The FileClient Computer 
    2. The FileServer Computer
    3. The KeyNegoServer Computer.

We describe how to set up each of these.   In addition, developers will compile,
test and run all these programs on a Development Computer.  We will describe the
setup of all these computers as well as how to use our software to provision them.
Our focus is the Development Computer.


Software setup of the Development Computer

1. Install Linux.  These instructions were written for Ubuntu 12.04.
2. Install the Linux Kernel Development environment using the instructions 
    in "LinuxDev.txt."
3. Create the directories that will the compiled object files and executables.
   Consult "DirectoryStructure.txt" to learn more about the directory structure.

For each FileClient, FileServer and Development Computer you want to use:

    4. Activate the TPM using the BIOS interface, using HW manufacturers 
        instructions.
    5. Take ownership of the TPM and generate the appropriate keys using the 
        instructions in "SetupTPM.txt"

On the Development Computer or KeyNegoServer Computer (depending on whether 
    you are developing or deploying):

6. Compile cryptUtility using the instructions in "cryptUtility.txt."

7. Generate a FileProxy public/private key pair and produce a self signed certificate
    using the instructions in "KeySetup.txt."  Provision the files produced as indicated 
    there, these files include the hardware certificate you produce for the AIK using
    the AIK Blob Files as well as a file icontaining the Public Key for the activity which
    will be compiled into FileClient and FileServer.

8.  Compile KeyNegoServer using the instructions in "KeyNegoServer.txt."
9.  Compile the "tcService" daemon using the instructions in "tcService.txt."
10. Compile FileServer and FileClient using the instructions in "FileProxyApps.txt."
11. Build TBOOT and configure any FileClient, FileServer and Development Computer you
    use to perform a DRTMBoot using the instructions in "DRTMBoot.txt."

If this is a Development Computer, use the instructions in "RunningFileProxy.txt" to
run and test these programs.

If you are building a deployable FileProxy system, you must setup KeyNegoServer, build
a Trusted OS image and FileClient and FileServer Linux images (including a special initramfs)
that you can deploy.  To do this, consult:

    a. "OperatingKeyNegoServer.txt" for KeyNegoServer.
    b. "BuildingTrustedOS.txt" for building a trusted OS and configuring GRUB.
    c. "BuildingInitRamFs.txt" for building the initramfs file system for the
        FileClient and FileServer computers.
    d. "ConfiguringFileProxyPrograms.txt" for configuration and deployment instructions
        for FileClient and FileProxy Computers.

Have fun!
