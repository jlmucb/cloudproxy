Instructions for testing fileProxy on KVM
=========================================



1. stop tcsd if started

  /etc/init.d/trousers stop 

2. make sure you have access to the tpm device. 

  chown <username> /dev/tpm0

you will have to log out and back in to get the right group permissions.

3. add tcioDD to the kernel  
  cd ~/jlmcrypt
  insmod tcHvioDD.ko
  chmod 0777 /dev/tcHvIoDD0

The first time you run tcService, you must run it with the -initKeys flag.  
This generates the OS keys stores them and causes keyNegoServer to sign them.  
In the paper, this is called "tao initialization" for the OS.  keyNegoServer 
need only be available when a tao layer needs to initialize.  Here
is a procedure.  Start keyNegoServer.  In a different console on the 
fileProxy machine, type:

./tcService.exe -initKeys

Unlike a normal run of tcService where tcService continues running, 
tcService will exit after the keys are generated and the cert signed 
and stored.  

Next prepare the test files for fileClient

If you are running the standard test, suppose CODE is 
the directory where the fileProxy code is and ROOT is the directory
you store your executables (usually jlmcrypt); do the following:

    mkdir ROOT/fileClient/tests
    mkdir -p ROOT/fileProxy/files
    cd ROOT
    CODE/scripts/createSimpleTest.py --scriptPath CODE/scripts
    mv basicTest fileClient/tests/

createSimpleTest.py creates a new public/private key pair for a user JohnManferdelli/0001,
generates the public and private key XML files, creates a new test file file.test and a 
test overview file tests.xml. It also creates a signed authorization file with the single
statement

    //www.manferdelli.com/User/JohnManferdelli/0001 maycreate //www.manferdelli.com/Gauss/fileProxy/files

This code assumes that the policy key can be found in ROOT/policy/privatePolicyKey.xml and that
cryptUtility.exe is in ROOT/cryptUtility.exe


Now, as a regular user, execute the following commands:
./tcService.exe &
sleep 2s
./fileServer.exe -initProg
sleep 2s
./fileClient.exe -initProg
sleep 5s

You should see the following output on the command line:

    basicFileCreate: [OK]
    basicFileWrite: [OK]
    basicFileRead: [OK]

see the file fileClient/tests/basicTest/tests.xml for the XML test format, and see the examples
in CODE/SupportFiles/tests for other samples. Note that these samples have already been 
signed by a policy key and will need to be generated again using the scripts in CODE/scripts
to work in an environment with a different policy key
