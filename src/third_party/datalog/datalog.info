1 Introduction
**************

The Datalog package contains a lightweight deductive database system.
Queries and database updates are expressed using Datalog--a declarative
logic language in which each formula is a function-free Horn clause,
and every variable in the head of a clause must appear in the body of
the clause.  The use of Datalog syntax and an implementation based on
tabling intermediate results, ensures that all queries terminate.

   The components in this package are designed to be small, and usable
on memory constrained devices.  The package includes an interactive
interpreter for Datalog, and a library that can be employed to embed a
small deductive database into C programs.  The library uses the tabled
logic programming algorithm described in "Efficient Top-Down
Computation of Queries under the Well-Founded Semantics", Chen, W.,
Swift, T., and Warren, D. S., `J. Logic Prog.', Vol. 24, No. 3, Sep.
1995, pp. 161-199.  Another important reference is "Tabled Evaluation
with Delaying for General Logic Programs", Chen, W., and Warren, D. S.,
`J. ACM', Vol. 43, No. 1, Jan. 1996, pp. 20-74.  Datalog is described
in "What You Always Wanted to Know About Datalog (And Never Dared to
Ask)", Stefano Ceri, Georg Gottlob, and Letizia Tanca, `IEEE
Transactions of Knowledge and Data Engineering', Vol. 1, No. 1, March
1989.

2 Tutorial
**********

Datalog is introduced by showing a sequence of interactions with a
Datalog interpreter.  The interpreter is started with the `datalog'
command.

     $ datalog
     Datalog 2.4

     >

   Facts are stored in tables.  If the name of the table is `parent',
and `john' is the parent of `douglas', store the fact in the database
with this:

     > parent(john, douglas).

   Each item in the parenthesized list following the name of the table
is called a "term".  A term can be either a logical variable or a
constant.  Thus far, all the terms shown have been constant terms.

   A query can be used to see if a particular row is in a table.  Type
this to see if `john' is the parent of `douglas':

     > parent(john, douglas)?
     parent(john, douglas).

   Type this to see if `john' is the parent of `ebbon':

     > parent(john, ebbon)?

   The query produced no results because `john' is not the parent of
`ebbon'.  Let's add more rows.

     > parent(bob, john).
     > parent(ebbon, bob).

   Type the following to list all rows in the `parent' table:

     > parent(A, B)?
     parent(john, douglas).
     parent(bob, john).
     parent(ebbon, bob).

   Type the following to list all the children of `john':

     > parent(john, B)?
     parent(john, douglas).

   A term that begins with a capital letter is a logical "variable".
When producing a set of answers, the Datalog interpreter lists all rows
that match the query when each variable in the query is substituted for
a constant.  The following example produces no answers, as there are no
substitutions for the variable `A' that produce a fact in the database.
This is because no one is the parent of oneself.

     > parent(A, A)?

   A deductive database can use rules of inference to derive new facts.
Consider the following rule:

     > ancestor(A, B) :- parent(A, B).

   The rule says that if A is the parent of B, then A is an ancestor of
B.  The other rule defining an ancestor says that if A is the parent of
C, C is an ancestor of B, then A is an ancestor of B.

     > ancestor(A, B) :- \
     >>   parent(A, C),  \
     >>   ancestor(C, B).

   In the interpreter, a line can be continued by ending it with the
backslash character.

   Rules are used to answer queries just as is done for facts.

     > ancestor(A, B)?
     ancestor(ebbon, bob).
     ancestor(ebbon, douglas).
     ancestor(bob, john).
     ancestor(john, douglas).
     ancestor(ebbon, john).
     ancestor(bob, douglas).
     > ancestor(X,john)?
     ancestor(bob, john).
     ancestor(ebbon, john).

   A fact or a rule can be retracted from the database using tilde
syntax:

     > parent(bob, john)~
     > parent(A,B)?
     parent(john, douglas).
     parent(ebbon, bob).
     > ancestor(A,B)?
     ancestor(john, douglas).
     ancestor(ebbon, bob).

   Unlike Prolog, the order in which clauses are asserted is irrelevant.
All queries terminate, and every possible answer is derived.

     > q(X) :- p(X).
     > q(a).
     > p(X) :- q(X).
     > q(X)?
     q(a).

3 Interpreter
*************

The `datalog' program provides access to a deductive database in both
interactive or batch mode.  In batch mode, the program reads a Datalog
program, prints the answers to its query, and then exits.  In
interactive mode, the program treats each line of text it reads as a
Datalog program, prints the answer to its query, and then prompts for
more input.

   The `datalog' interpreter accepts the following options:

     $ datalog -h
     Usage: datalog [options] [file]
     Options:
       -o file -- output to file (default is standard output)
       -i      -- enter interactive mode after loading file
       -l file -- load extensions written in Lua
       -t      -- print output as tab separated values
       -v      -- print version information
       -h      -- print this message
     Use - as a file name to specify standard input

   When in interactive mode, if the first character of a line of input
is the equals sign, the remaining text on the line is used as the name
of a file that is loaded into the interpreter.  An incomplete line of
text can be continued by ending the line with the backslash character.

4 Primitive Predicates
**********************

The interpreter provides an equality predicate with infix notation.
Two terms are equal if both terms are the same constant, or one is a
constant and the other is a variable.

     > 1 = 2?
     > 1 = 1?
     1 = 1.
     > X = 1?
     1 = 1.
     > X = X?

5 Syntax
********

In Datalog input, whitespace characters are ignored except when they
separate adjacent tokens or when they occur in strings.  Comments are
also considered to be whitespace.  The character `%' introduces a
comment, which extends to the next line break.  Comments do not occur
inside strings.

   The characters in Datalog input are collected into tokens according
to the rules that follow.  There are four classes of tokens:
punctuations, variables, identifiers, and strings.  The punctuation
tokens are: `(', `,', `)', `=', `:-', `.', `~', `?', and `"'.

   A variable is a sequence of Latin capital and small letters, digits,
and the underscore character.  A variable must begin with a Latin
capital letter.

   An identifier is a sequence of printing characters that does not
contain any of the following characters: `(', `,', `)', `=', `:', `.',
`~', `?', `"', `%', and space.  An identifier must not begin with a
Latin capital letter.  Note that the characters that start punctuation
are forbidden in identifiers, but the hyphen character is allowed.

   A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.
Characters other than double quote, newline, and backslash can be
directly included in a string.  The remaining characters can be
specified using escape characters, `\"', `\n', and `\\' respectively.

   Other escape characters can be used to improve the readability of the
input.  If a string is too long to fit conveniently on one line, all
but the final line containing the string can be ended with a backslash
character, and each backslash newline pair is ignored.  The character
escape codes from the C programming language are allowed--`\a', `\b',
`\f', `\n', `\r', `\t', `\v', `\'', and `\?'.  The numeric escape codes
consist of one, two, or three octal digits.  Thus the ASCII character
newline is `\012', and zero is `\000'.  A printed Datalog string is
also a string constant in C.

5.1 Literals
============

A "literal", is a predicate symbol followed by an optional
parenthesized list of comma separated terms.  A "predicate symbol" is
either an identifier or a string.  A term is either a variable or a
constant.  As with predicate symbols, a "constant" is either an
identifier or a string.  The following are literals:

     parent(john, douglas)
     zero-arity-literal
     aBcD(-0, "\n\377")
     "="(3,3)
     ""(-0-0-0,&&&,***,"\0")

5.2 Clauses
===========

A "clause" is a "head" literal followed by an optional body.  A "body"
is a comma separated list of literals.  A clause without a body is
called a "fact", and a "rule" when it has one.  The punctuation `:-'
separates the head of a rule from its body.  A clause is "safe" if
every variable in its head occurs in some literal in its body.  The
following are safe clauses:

     parent(john, douglas)
     ancestor(A, B) :-
         parent(A, B)
     ancestor(A, B) :-
         parent(A, C),
         ancestor(C, B)

5.3 Programs
============

A Datalog reader consumes a Datalog program.  A "program" is a sequence
of zero or more statements, followed by an optional query.  A statement
is an assertion or a retraction.  An "assertion" is a clause followed
by a period, and it adds the clause to the database if it is safe.  A
"retraction" is a clause followed by a tilde, and it removes the clause
from the database.  A "query" is a literal followed by a question mark.
The effect of reading a Datalog program is to modify the database as
directed by its statements, and then to return the literal designated
as the query.  If no query is specified, a reader returns a literal
know to have no answers.  The following is a program:

     edge(a, b). edge(b, c). edge(c, d). edge(d, a).
     path(X, Y) :- edge(X, Y).
     path(X, Y) :- edge(X, Z), path(Z, Y).
     path(X, Y)?

6 Import/Export
***************

Tab separated values is a simple text format for a database table.
Each record in the table is one line of text.  Fields within the record
are separated by the tab character.  The script below translates a file
of tab separated values into Datalog syntax.

     #! /bin/sh
     sed 's/\\/\\\\/g;s/"/\\"/g' -- "$@" | awk -F'\t' '
     {
         if (NF == 0)
             print "data()."
         else {
             printf("data(\"%s\"", $1)
             for (i = 2; i <= NF; i++)
                 printf(", \"%s\"", $i)
             print ")."
         }
     }'

   The `-t' option causes the `datalog' program to print answers to
queries as tab separated values.  The following script removes quoting
introduced by `datalog'.

     #! /bin/sh
     sed 's/"\([^\t]*\)"/\1/g' -- "$@" | awk '
     BEGIN { print "BEGIN {" }
     { print "print \""$0"\"" }
     END { print "}" }' | awk -f -

   An example using `/etc/passwd' as a database table follows.  The
example shows a convoluted way of determining my home directory, but
never the less demonstrates the integration of `datalog' with other
Unix tools.  In this example, assume the Datalog import script above
has been placed into the file `datalogimport'.

     sed 's/:/\t/g' /etc/passwd \
     | datalogimport \
     | sed '
     $a\home(A,F):-data(A,B,C,D,E,F,G).\
     home(ramsdell,Dir)?' \
     | datalog -t - \
     | sed 's/\t/:/g'

   The first `sed' command converts `/etc/passwd' to tab separated
values, the second `sed' command adds a rule and a query to the Datalog
program, and the last `sed' command converts the output to colon
separated values.  On my machine, the above script produces
`ramsdell:/home/ramsdell'.

   Notice that input to `datalog' is obtained from `sed' using the `-'
option rather than implicitly via standard input.  Using the `-' option
avoids prompt printing and other features of the interactive loop.

7 Extensions
************

Adding primitive predicates to the Datalog interpreter requires
knowledge of its internals.  Much of the functionality of the
interpreter is implemented using an embedded language called Lua,
available at `http://www.lua.org'.  Lua provides the needed
infrastructure and a small footprint.  As an added bonus, the Lua
language is a gem.  Knowledge of Lua is a prerequisite for what follows.

   The mechanics of adding primitives is straightforward.  Put your
extensions in a file and load it using the `-l' option.  The more
difficult part is to decide what code should be loaded.

   The source file for the Datalog specific Lua code is installed in the
Datalog package's data directory.  The path name of the source file
typically ends with `share/datalog/datalog.lua'.  The section with a
comment containing the words "PRIMITIVES" is relevant.

   There is good support for the case in which a primitive can be
defined in terms of a Lua iterator.  The file `datalog.lua' defines the
`datalog' module, and it contains the function `add_iter_prim'.  This
function defines a primitive when given a predicate symbol, its arity,
and an iterator.

   When given a literal, the iterator generates a sequences of answers.
Each answer must be an array.  Each element in the array must be either
a number or a string.  The length of the array must be equal to the
arity of the predicate.

   What follows is a predicate defined by an iterator that produces one
answer, and the answer has one element in it--the number three.

     local function all_threes(literal)
       return function (s, v)
         if v then
           return nil
         else
           return {3}
         end
     end
     datalog.add_iter_prim("three", 1, all_threes)

   This primitive for addition shows how to ask if term `t' is a
constant via the construct `t:is_const()'.

     local function add(literal)
        return function(s, v)
                  if v then
                     return nil
                  else
                     local x = literal[1]
                     local y = literal[2]
                     local z = literal[3]
                     if y:is_const() and z:is_const() then
                        return {y.id + z.id, y.id, z.id}
                     elseif x:is_const() and z:is_const() then
                        return {x.id, x.id - z.id, z.id}
                     elseif x:is_const() and y:is_const() then
                        return {x.id, y.id, x.id - y.id}
                     else
                        return nil
                     end
                  end
               end
     end
     datalog.add_iter_prim("add", 3, add)

   The above primitive fails when given a non-numeric argument.  A more
robust implementation of the predicate ensures that arguments are
numbers before performing arithmetic.

     local function add(literal)
        return function(s, v)
                  if v then
                     return nil
                  else
                     local x = literal[1]
                     local y = literal[2]
                     local z = literal[3]
                     if y:is_const() and z:is_const() then
                        local j = tonumber(y.id)
                        local k = tonumber(z.id)
                        if j and k then
                           return {j + k, j, k}
                        else
                           return nil
                        end
                     elseif x:is_const() and z:is_const() then
                        local i = tonumber(x.id)
                        local k = tonumber(z.id)
                        if i and k then
                           return {i, i - k, k}
                        else
                           return nil
                        end
                     elseif x:is_const() and y:is_const() then
                        local i = tonumber(x.id)
                        local j = tonumber(y.id)
                        if i and j then

*************

The Datalog module can be used by the stand-alone Lua interpreter.
Load it with

     require "datalog"

   In the remainder of this chapter, a use of the Datalog module is
demonstrated by translating the following Datalog program into Lua.

     q(X) :- p(X).
     q(a).
     p(X) :- q(X).
     q(X)?

   Abbreviations make the code more readable.

     mv = datalog.make_var
     mc = datalog.make_const
     ml = datalog.make_literal
     mr = datalog.make_clause

   A translation of `q(X) :- p(X).'

     do
        local head = ml("q", {mv("X")})
        local body = {ml("p", {mv("X")})}
        datalog.assert(mr(head, body))
     end

   A translation of `q(a).'

     do
        local head = ml("q", {mc("a")})
        datalog.assert(mr(head, {}))
     end

   A translation of `p(X) :- q(X).'

     do
        local head = ml("p", {mv("X")})
        local body = {ml("q", {mv("X")})}
        datalog.assert(mr(head, body))
     end

   Given a literal, the `ask' function uses it as a Datalog query and
then prints the answers.

     function ask(literal)
        local ans = datalog.ask(literal)
        if ans then
           for i = 1,#ans do
              io.write(ans.name)
              if ans.arity > 0 then
                 io.write("(")
                 io.write(ans[i][1])
                 for j = 2,ans.arity do
                    io.write(", ")
                    io.write(ans[i][j])
                 end
                 io.write(").\n")
              else
                 io.write(".\n")
              end
           end
        end
        return ans
     end

   A translation of the query `q(X)?'

     ask(ml("q", {mv("X")}))

   The answer printed.

     q(a).

9 Library
*********

The Datalog library makes the services provided by a Datalog
interpreter available to C programs as a set of C functions and types.
The interface is declared in the header file `datalog.h'.  The header
file contains useful comments.

   The state of a Datalog interpreter is maintained by a dynamically
allocated structure.  A pointer to this structure is passed as the
first argument to every C function in the library, except to `dl_open',
which allocates the structure, and returns it as a pointer of type
`dl_db_t'.

     dl_db_t dl_open(void);

   If an error occurs, `dl_open' returns the null pointer.  To release
the resources associated with a Datalog interpreter, call `dl_close'.

     void dl_close(dl_db_t);

   The package name followed by the version number of the library is
returned by `dl_version'.

     const char* dl_version(void);

9.1 Asserting
=============

There are two ways to build literals and clauses, and assert and
retract clauses.  This section describes the low-level interface.  It
builds items by pushing each of its component on a stack, and then
inserting it into the result.  The high-level Datalog program loader is
described later.

   The remaining int returning functions in this interface return zero
on success, unless othewise noted.  The maximum size of the stack
manipulated by the functions is four, but implementations may provide a
larger stack.

9.1.1 Strings
-------------

Push a string on the top of the stack.  The string may contain zeros.

     int dl_pushlstring(dl_db_t db, const char *s, size_t n);

   Push a string on the top of the stack.  The string must be zero
terminated.

     int dl_pushstring(dl_db_t db, const char *s);

   Concatenate two strings.  Pops two strings off the top of the stack
and then pushes the concatenation of the two strings on the top of the
stack.

     int dl_concat(dl_db_t db);

9.1.2 Literals
--------------

Start a literal.  Pushes an incompleted literal on the top of the stack.

     int dl_pushliteral(dl_db_t db);

   Make a string and then use this to add a predicate symbol to a
literal.  Pops the string from stack.  For each literal, this must be
done once, and can be done after some number of terms have been added.

     int dl_addpred(dl_db_t db);

   Make a string and then use this to add a variable to the list of
terms of a literal.  Pops the string from stack.

     int dl_addvar(dl_db_t db);

   Make a string and then use this to add a constant to the list of
terms of a literal.  Pops the string from stack.

     int dl_addconst(dl_db_t db);

   Finish making a literal after adding all terms and one predicate
symbol.  Leaves a completed literal on the top of the stack.

     int dl_makeliteral(dl_db_t db);

9.1.3 Clauses
-------------

Make a literal and then use this to start a clause.  Pops a literal
from the stack and leaves a newly created, incomplete clause on top of
the stack.  The head of the clause is the literal.

     int dl_pushhead(dl_db_t db);

   Make a literal and then use this to add it to the clause's body.
Pops a literal from the stack, and inserts it into the incomplete
clause on the top of the stack.

     int dl_addliteral(dl_db_t db);

   Finish the clause.  Leaves a completed clause on the top of the
stack.

     int dl_makeclause(dl_db_t db);

9.1.4 Actions
-------------

Asserts the clause on the top of the stack.  The clause is added to the
database and popped off the stack.  Returns -1 when a clause is not
safe.

     int dl_assert(dl_db_t db);

   Retracts the clause on the top of the stack.  The clause is removed
from the database and popped off the stack.

     int dl_retract(dl_db_t db);

9.2 Querying
============

A literal on the stack can be used to query the database.

     int dl_ask(dl_db_t db, dl_answers_t *a);

   This function asks for a list that contains all ground instances of a
literal that are a logical consequence of the clauses stored in the
database.  An instance of a literal is "ground", if it is the result of
substituting some constant for each variable that occurs in the
literal.  The function always pops the literal from the stack.  If some
answers are found, they are returned by assigning to the `a' parameter,
a pointer to a freshly allocated list of answers of type
`dl_answers_t'.  The `a' parameter is assigned the null pointer when
there are errors or no answers.  The `dl_ask' function returns a
non-zero value on error.

     void dl_free(dl_answers_t a);

   The `dl_free' function frees the space associated with a list of
answers.

   A description of the functions that access the components of a list
of answers completes this section.

     char *dl_getpred(dl_answers_t a);

   This function gets the predicate symbol associated with the answers.
If the length of the predicate is N, N + 1 character locations are
returned, and the last location is zero.  Other character locations in
the predicate may be zero.  This function returns the null pointer if
given it.

     size_t dl_getpredlen(dl_answers_t a);

   This function gets the length of the predicate symbol associated with
the answers.  This function returns zero if given the null pointer.

     size_t dl_getpredarity(dl_answers_t a);

   This function gets the number of terms that makes up each answer.
This number is called the predicate's arity.  It returns zero if given
the null pointer.

     char *dl_getconst(dl_answers_t a, int i, int j);

   This function gets the constant associated with term `j' in answer
`i'.  Zero-based indexing is used throughout.  If the length of the
constant is N, N + 1 character locations are returned, and the last
location is zero.  Other character locations in the constant may be
zero.  If there is no specified term or no answers at all, the null
pointer is returned.

     size_t dl_getconstlen(dl_answers_t a, int i, int j);

   This function gets the length of the constant associated with term
`j' in answer `i'.  Zero-based indexing is used throughout.  If there
is no specified term or no answers at all, zero is returned.

9.3 Printing
============

The functions in this section provide support for printing using the
loader's syntax for constants.

     void dl_putlconst(FILE *out, const char *s, size_t n);

   Print a constant of a given length.  The function assumes the
constant has N + 1 character locations, and the last location is zero.
Other character locations in the constant may be zero.

     void dl_putconst(FILE *out, const char *s);

   Print a zero terminated constant.

     size_t dl_widthoflconst(const char *s, size_t n);

   Determine the columns needed for a constant with a given length.  The
function assumes the constant has N + 1 character locations, and the
last location is zero.  Other character locations in the constant may
be zero.

     size_t dl_widthofconst(const char *s);

   Determine the columns needed for a zero terminated constant.

9.4 Loading
===========

The loader reads a Datalog program.  A program is a sequence of zero or
more assertions or retractions, followed by an optional query expressed
as a literal.  While reading, the loader performs the assertions and
retractions requested by the program.  It finishes by pushing the query
literal on the Datalog interpreter's stack.  If no query is specified,
it pushes a literal known to have no answers.

   The loader obtains buffers containing characters by calling a
function given to it of type `dl_reader_t'.

     typedef const char *(*dl_reader_t)(void *data, size_t *size);

   When called by the loader, the reader is given the data supplied to
the loader as its first argument.  If there is no more input available,
the reader returns a null pointer, otherwise it assigns the size of the
buffer to the `size' parameter, and then returns a pointer to the
buffer.

   The loader reports errors by calling a function given to it of type
`dl_loaderror_t'.

     typedef void (*dl_loaderror_t)(void *data, int lineno,
                                    int colno, const char *msg);

   When a loader error occurs, the loader calls this function with the
data supplied to the loader, the location of the error as a line number
and column number, and an error message.

     int dl_load(dl_db_t database, dl_reader_t reader,
                 dl_loaderror_t loaderror, void *data);

   This function loads a Datalog program.  It uses a reader to obtain a
sequence of buffers that contain the program.  The load error reporter
is called when the loader detects an error, and then a non-zero value
is returned, otherwise, the loader returns zero.  The value in the data
parameter is passed to both of the supplied functions whenever they are
called.

   Upon success, the loader leaves a literal on the Datalog
interpreter's stack.  To ignore this literal, call `dl_pop'.

     int dl_pop(dl_db_t db);

   The `dl_loadbuffer' function loads a Datalog program contained in
one buffer.

     int dl_loadbuffer(dl_db_t database, const char *buffer,
                       size_t size, dl_loaderror_t loaderror);
