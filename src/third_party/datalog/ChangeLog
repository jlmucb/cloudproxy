2013-03-23  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* config.guess, config.sub: Distribution rebuild to support the
	ARM 64 bit CPU architecture (aarch64).

	* git: Tagged as datalog-2.4 with tag v2.4.

2012-09-29  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* git: Tagged as datalog-2.3 with tag v2.3.

2012-04-28  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* loader.c (pushstring): Added a check for hexadecimal escape
	sequences in strings.  An error is signaled when one is found.

	* stackless.diff: Added a patch that prevents Lua stack exhaustion
	when evaluating deep queries.  It does so by moving Datalog search
	control information from the Lua stack into a table of thunks.
	This patch addresses an issue reported by Pierre Carbonnelle.

2012-04-26  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* git: Tagged as datalog-2.2 with tag v2.2.

2012-04-20  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* interp.c (getaline): Added a space to the prompt.  The space was
	inadvertently deleted when readline support was added.

2012-04-18  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* tc.dl: Added a test case based on the transitive closure.

2012-04-13  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	datalog module in the stand-alone Lua interpreter.

	* datalog.texi (Library):  Added a section on making assertions via
	the C API.

2012-04-08  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* git: Tagged as datalog-2.1 with tag v2.1.

	* try.sh, Makefile.am: Changed the extension used for Datalog input
	from .prolog to .dl.

	* interp.c (getaline): Fixed end of line bugs when using
	readline for the case of a line continued with '\' and when
	reading a file with '='.

	* add.lua: Added checks to ensure arguments are numbers.

	* datalog.c (dl_pcall, dl_lua): Removed DATALOG_DEBUG, and now
	always print the error message returned from Lua.  This message is
	very useful now that its so easy to add primitives using the -l
	option.

2012-04-07  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* git: Tagged as datalog-2.0 with tag v2.0.

	* configure.ac:  Enabled the use of the one C99 feature used in
	the program.  When compiled with a C99 compiler, pushstring in
	loader.c uses a variable length array instead of a malloc.

	* interp.c (getaline): Added support for GNU readline in the
	interpreter when it is available.

2012-04-06  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* loader.c (addstr): Fixed two bugs associated with the end of a
	string.  Fixed the case in which the last character in a buffer is
	double quote and the previous character is part of a numerical
	escape.  Also fixed the case in which a pushed buffer was followed
	by a buffer read giving a double quote, but the state s1 was not
	SEEN_NOTHING.

2012-04-05  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* loader.c (pushstring, addstr): In order to better integrate with
	other Unix tools, numeric string escapes now consist of one, two,
	or three octal digits.  This change makes this version
	incompatible with previous versions.

	* interp.c (main): Added the -l option that loads a Lua script
	after the loading of datalog.lua.  The Lua script can be used to
	add primitives.

2012-04-04  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* NEWS: Converted the file to use outline format.

2012-04-03  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	how to import and export tab seperated values.

2012-04-01  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	option that prints answers using tab separated values.

	* datalog.texi (Extending): Added a reference to the addition
	primitive comment in datalog.lua.in.

	* datalog.lua.in (add_iter_prim): Added a comment that shows how
	to add addition as a primitive.

	* datalog.lua.in (mk_intern): Coerced identifiers to be interned
	into a string instead of relying on callers to always provide a
	string.

	testing against a constant address.

	* bin2c.c (print_version): Remove compiler warnings about testing
	against a constant address.

	* configure.ac: Corrected the NO_LUA test.  Added check for
	lauxlib.h.  Changed lua function used in lua library check from
	lua_pcall to lua_pushboolean, as lua_pcall is a macro in Lua 5.2.

2012-01-18  John D. Ramsdell  <ramsdell@mitre.org>

	* datalog.lua.in, COPYING.LIB: Fixed the address of the Free

	libraries via libtool.  The default is static libraries.
